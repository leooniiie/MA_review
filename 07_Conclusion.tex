As one can see, a phased GRU can predict conversion given a customer journey more reliably than the base GRU and LSTM models while using fewer parameters.\\ 

Obviously, the next step would be to add explanations to the model, whether it is using the shap package as soon as they are compatible with sequential data or to programming an own version that is compatible with the phased GRU model. 

Even though the predictions might be more accurate using neural networks, especially the phased GRU network, question still remains how much more and better information does such a model provide to a company compared to other simpler or easier interpretable models.
