\chapter{Introduction}
Effectively allocating marketing budgets is a challenging decision for marketers, especially with expanding advertising opportunities. 
The importance of each individual marketing channel heavily depends on the brand and product one tries to advertise, so there isn't one universally best marketing strategy to maximize return on investment (ROI). 
Knowing which ads, a customer was exposed to, one could try to derive the importance of each advertising channel. 
\\ 
Traditionally, heuristic approaches are used to assess the impact of marketing channels, for example, last-click attribution where the last ad a customer was exposed to before buying gets all the credits for the conversion. However, with the rise of mobile devices and online advertising, the volume of available data has skyrocketed, which led to the emergence of data-driven methods. This allows for more precise attribution but also introduces complexity. \\
